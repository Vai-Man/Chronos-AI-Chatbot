# Chronos AI Chatbot

Chronos is an AI chatbot built with React. It speaks as a historian from the year **2475 CE**, answering questions with full access to historical records from **1995 to 2100**. It responds with confidence, as if reporting from official archives.

Use it to explore alternate futures, simulate world events, or build interactive experiences where history meets speculation.

## How It Works

Chronos is designed to simulate a historian AI from the future. It doesn’t guess or speculate — it speaks with authority, as if every event already happened. It can describe wars, discoveries, disasters, and political shifts with full detail.

You ask it questions. It answers with clarity, precision, and historical tone.
